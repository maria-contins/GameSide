# GamesTUI: Card-Based Tangible User Interface Framework

## Overview

This repository contains games designed to test and validate a card-based tangible user interface (TUI). The framework supports interaction through physical cards and includes features to enhance usability and configurability. It integrates with a middleware application for communication and provides tools for streamlined input handling and interface customization.


- **Communication Handler**: Facilitates interaction with a middleware application via socket communication for real-time data exchange.
- **Input Helper**: Simplifies the process of adding new input forms to games, improving development efficiency.
- **Configuration Window**: Offers a user-friendly interface for adjusting settings and preferences.
- **Navigation Menu**: Provides intuitive navigation across different sections of the application.
